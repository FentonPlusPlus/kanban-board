# Plan of Action

1. **Go through the program**
2. **Identify what you know**
    - Thing’s I know
        - Classes
        - Routes
        - Controllers
        - Constructors
        - Data and Functions belonging to that class
        - SQL queries
3. **Identify what you don’t know (…and research it)**

4. **Understand Achitecture of Program**

5. **Run the tests**
6. **Identify the problems of each task (test that’s failing)**

## Reflections

- The effiency of success relies upon you knowing the program and understanding how it is connected. Things that can help this are:
    - ERD and UML Class Diagram of the program and data
    - Going through each class and each line of code, understanding how everything is connected
        - Which classes rely on other classes
    - The above helps with the overwhelming feeling at the start which can be fuddling
